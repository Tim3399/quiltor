# Linting

Every linter here is blocking: zero findings on the whole repository, and a new finding
turns the gate red. A rule is switched off only with a reason, written next to the
configuration where the format allows comments, otherwise in this file.

## zizmor

Security audit of `.github/workflows/*.yml`: template injection, credentials persisted by
`actions/checkout`, dangerous triggers, excessive permissions, unpinned actions and about
forty more audits. It complements `distribution/tooling/workflow_contract.py`, which checks
pinning and runtimes but not what a workflow does with its inputs.

- **Version:** 1.31.1, pinned in `distribution/toolchains.json` (`lintTools.zizmor`) and,
  hash-checked, in `distribution/lint-tools.requirements.txt`. `tools/dev/lint-tool.mjs`
  refuses any other version.
- **Install:**
  `py -3.12 -m pip install --require-hashes --only-binary=:all: -r distribution/lint-tools.requirements.txt`
- **Run:** `npm run lint:zizmor`. Part of `npm run check`, and of the `frontend` CI job.
- **Mode:** `--offline`, default persona. The online audits (`impostor-commit`,
  `known-vulnerable-actions`, `ref-version-mismatch`) need a GitHub token; without one a
  local run and CI would audit different things.
- **Why not `tools/dev/python.mjs`:** the zizmor wheel installs an executable and no Python
  module, so there is nothing for `--needs` to import. The runner looks in the scripts
  directory of the same interpreters `python.mjs` tries, then on PATH.

Exceptions, each with its reason where it is made:

| Where                                                                | Audit                | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `release-publish.yml`, `workflow_run` trigger                        | `dangerous-triggers` | The hand-off from Release Build. The job re-reads the run through the API, requires `release.yml` on main at the current head, and only then checks out that SHA.                                           |
| `release.yml`, `release-context` checkout                            | `artipacked`         | Keeps the token to fetch `origin/main`; the job uploads no artifact. Written as `persist-credentials: true`.                                                                                                |
| `visual-baselines-bootstrap.yml`, `bootstrap` checkout               | `artipacked`         | Pushes the generated baselines with that token; its upload takes only test results and the Vite log.                                                                                                        |
| `.github/zizmor.yml`, seven lines of the Release Build manifest step | `template-injection` | `tests/python/test_release.py` asserts those `${{ }}` expressions literally. The values are this workflow's own validated job outputs. The ignores are by line, so moving the step makes zizmor fail again. |

Everywhere else the findings were fixed: `persist-credentials: false` on every other
checkout, and step outputs passed to scripts through `env:` instead of `${{ }}`.

## actionlint

Syntax and expression checks for the same workflows: unknown keys, wrong `${{ }}` types,
matrix and `needs` references, runner labels. Every `run:` script goes through shellcheck.

- **Version:** 1.7.12, pinned with download URL and SHA-256 in `distribution/toolchains.json`.
- **Run:** `npm run lint:actionlint`. Locally only when installed; otherwise it prints
  `actionlint not installed, runs in CI` and exits 0. `npm run doctor` shows the
  download line. In CI (`workflow-docker-shell-lint` job) a missing binary is an error.
- **shellcheck inside `run:`:** used when the pinned shellcheck is on PATH; without it the
  runner says that the scripts were skipped. CI always has it.
- **pyflakes:** switched off (`-pyflakes=`). No step uses `shell: python`, and an
  unpinned pyflakes on PATH must not change the result.

In-script exception: `release.yml`, macOS keychain setup, `SC2046` — the existing keychain
list is split into separate arguments on purpose.

## hadolint

Lints `Dockerfile` and `services/backup-server/Dockerfile` (every tracked `Dockerfile`),
including the shell inside `RUN`.

- **Version:** 2.15.1, pinned with download URL and SHA-256 in `distribution/toolchains.json`.
- **Config:** `distribution/containers/hadolint.yaml`, `failure-threshold: info` — every
  finding fails.
- **Run:** `npm run lint:hadolint`. Local and CI behaviour as for actionlint.

Rules switched off:

- **DL3059** (merge consecutive `RUN`), in the config: the separate `RUN` steps are build
  gates that should fail as their own step in the log; they add no files to the runtime.
- **DL3008** (pin apt versions), inline on the web runtime base: the base is pinned by
  digest, and the Ubuntu archive drops superseded versions, so a version pin breaks the
  build on the next security update.
- **DL3066** (numeric `USER`), inline in both Dockerfiles: the user is created by `useradd`
  in the same image; pinning a uid could lock existing `/data` volumes out.

## shellcheck

Lints every tracked `*.sh` (today the two macOS release scripts in
`distribution/desktop/macos/direct/`).

- **Version:** 0.11.0, pinned with download URL and SHA-256 in `distribution/toolchains.json`.
- **Run:** `npm run lint:shellcheck`. Local and CI behaviour as for actionlint.

In-script exception: `smoke-install.sh`, `SC2009` — the process check needs a fixed-string
match on an install path, and `pgrep -f` would read it as a regular expression.
